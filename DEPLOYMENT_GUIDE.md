# ðŸš€ Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## Deploy Your Urdu-Roman Neural Machine Translation App

Follow these steps to deploy your beautiful Urdu transliteration app to Streamlit Cloud:

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

Your code is already committed. Now push it to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. **Go to Streamlit Cloud**: Visit [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)

2. **Sign in with GitHub**: Use your GitHub account (marwa-coder)

3. **New App**: Click "New app"

4. **Repository Settings**:
   - **Repository**: `Marwah-coder/Neural-machine-translation-using-seq2saq-models`
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Main file path**: `streamlit_app.py`
   - **App URL**: Choose a custom URL (optional)

5. **Advanced Settings** (Click "Advanced settings"):
   - **Python version**: 3.9
   - **Requirements file**: `requirements_streamlit.txt`

6. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy!"

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment

- Streamlit will build your app (takes 2-5 minutes)
- You'll get a public URL like: `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`

### Step 4: Share Your App

Once deployed, you'll have a beautiful public URL that you can:
- Share on social media
- Add to your portfolio
- Use in presentations
- Include in your resume

## ðŸŽ¨ Your App Features

Your deployed app will have:

- âœ¨ **Beautiful UI**: Gradient backgrounds, animations, and modern design
- ðŸ”¤ **Urdu Support**: Proper Urdu font rendering with Noto Nastaliq Urdu
- ðŸ§  **AI Translation**: BiLSTM encoder + LSTM decoder with attention
- ðŸ“Š **Performance Metrics**: BLEU score, error rates, and model details
- ðŸŽ¯ **Real-time Translation**: Instant Urdu to Roman transliteration
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:

1. **Check requirements**: Make sure all dependencies are in `requirements_streamlit.txt`
2. **File paths**: Ensure model files are in the correct directories
3. **Memory**: Large model files might need optimization
4. **Logs**: Check deployment logs in Streamlit Cloud dashboard

### Common issues:

- **Model not found**: Ensure model files are committed to GitHub
- **Import errors**: Check all dependencies are listed in requirements
- **Memory issues**: Consider model quantization for smaller file sizes

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Tips

- Your model is optimized for CPU deployment
- Uses caching for faster loading
- Character-level tokenization for better accuracy
- Smart EOS handling for clean translations

## ðŸŒŸ Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Custom Domain**: You can add a custom domain in Streamlit Cloud settings
2. **Analytics**: Monitor usage in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard
3. **Updates**: Push changes to GitHub to automatically update the app
4. **Sharing**: Add the URL to your GitHub README and portfolio

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you encounter any issues:
- Check Streamlit Cloud documentation
- Review deployment logs
- Ensure all files are properly committed to GitHub
